      \n\n2. Condition: It is the second condition which is executed each time to test the condition of the loop. It continues execution until the condition is false. It must return boolean value either true or false. It is an optional condition. \
      \n\n3. Increment/Decrement: It increments or decrements the variable value. It is an optional condition. \
      \n\n4. Statement: The statement of the loop is executed each time until the second condition is false. \

      \n\nArray in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.\
      \n\nUnlike C/C++, we can get the length of the array using the length member. In C/C++, we need to use the sizeof operator.\
      \n\nIn Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java. Like C/C++, we can also create single dimentional or multidimentional arrays in Java.\
